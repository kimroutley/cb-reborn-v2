# Role Awards System Plan

Canonical location for the awards rollout plan.

## Source

Migrated from `AWARDS_SYSTEM_PLAN.md`.

## Scope summary

- Role-specific award ladders (rookie/pro/legend + bonuses)
- Deterministic progression and persistence contracts
- Host/player Hall-of-Fame integration
- Icon metadata and source-license guardrails

## Current implementation posture

Phase 0/1 foundations are implemented with deterministic profiles and coverage for canonical roles.

## Historical/full detail

Keep `AWARDS_SYSTEM_PLAN.md` available during migration parity checks. Treat this path as canonical for future edits.
