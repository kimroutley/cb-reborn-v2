# Awards Name + Icon Catalog

Canonical location for role-award title/icon metadata.

## Source

Migrated from `AWARDS_NAME_ICON_CATALOG.md`.

## Rules

- Keep role IDs canonical and stable.
- Track icon source + license metadata for every entry.
- Prefer permissive icon licenses (MIT/Apache), with attribution metadata when needed.

## Historical/full detail

Use `AWARDS_NAME_ICON_CATALOG.md` as migration-era full content source until parity merge is completed in this location.
