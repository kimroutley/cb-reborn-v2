Club Blackout Reborn - Gemini Handoff List
Date: 2026-02-13

1) Current Verified State
- Host app release build succeeded.
- Last successful command: Push-Location "apps/host"; flutter build apk --release; Pop-Location
- Artifact: apps/host/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

2) Documentation Work Completed
- PROJECT_DEVELOPER_HANDBOOK.md updated:
  - Last Updated -> February 13, 2026
  - Build status refreshed (Host verified, Player pending fresh full rerun)
  - Release readiness split into:
    - Stable applicationId (done)
    - Keystore-backed signing (still pending)
  - Repeatable build/install notes marked complete
- README.md updated with:
  - Debug APK install steps
  - Release APK install steps
- apps/host/README.md updated with:
  - Debug APK install steps
  - Release APK install steps

3) Markdown Lint Status (Docs)
- README.md: clean (no markdown errors reported)
- apps/host/README.md: clean (no markdown errors reported)
- PROJECT_DEVELOPER_HANDBOOK.md: still has legacy markdown style noise, mainly:
  - MD060 table alignment/style warnings
  - MD040 one code-fence missing language
  - Some mixed list style remnants

4) Code/Build Risks Still Open
- Host keystore signing is not fully configured for ship-ready signed release.
- CI does not fully guarantee Host release regression detection in current flow.
- Player app had recent edits and should be revalidated now.

5) Recent Player Files Changed (Needs Validation)
- apps/player/lib/screens/settings_screen.dart
- apps/player/lib/player_stats.dart
- apps/player/lib/screens/stats_screen.dart

6) Recommended Immediate Validation Commands
- cd apps/player ; flutter pub get
- cd apps/player ; flutter analyze
- cd apps/player ; flutter test

7) Optional Host Re-Check Commands
- cd apps/host ; flutter analyze
- cd apps/host ; flutter test
- cd apps/host ; flutter build apk --release

8) If Gemini Should Continue Docs Cleanup
- Target file: PROJECT_DEVELOPER_HANDBOOK.md
- Scope: formatting-only pass (no meaning/content changes)
- Goal: remove MD060/MD040/style warnings and keep existing wording intact

9) Ground Rules Already Followed
- No generated files were edited.
- No runtime feature behavior was changed during doc-only cleanup.
- README/install paths are Windows PowerShell compatible.

10) Fresh Test Run Results (Executed Now)
- Command run (Host): Push-Location "apps/host"; flutter test; Pop-Location
- Result (Host): FAILED (compilation/test load failed)
  - packages/cb_theme/lib/src/screens/guide_screen.dart: invalid references to `theme.colorScheme` when `theme` is already a `ColorScheme`, and undefined `scheme` symbol.
  - apps/host/lib/main.dart + packages/cb_logic/lib/src/firebase_analytics_provider.dart: missing `firebase_analytics` package resolution.
  - apps/host/lib/screens/host_home_shell.dart: `GamePhase` symbol not resolved in current imports/scope.
  - apps/host/lib/screens/about_screen.dart, game_screen.dart, guides_screen.dart: `CustomDrawer` now requires `onDrawerItemTap` but calls are missing it.
  - apps/host/lib/screens/lobby_screen.dart: `HostBridge.port` getter not found.

- Command run (Player): Push-Location "apps/player"; flutter test; Pop-Location
- Result (Player): FAILED (compilation/test load failed)
  - apps/player/lib/screens/games_night_screen.dart: unresolved `intl` / `DateFormat` (dependency/import mismatch).
  - packages/cb_theme/lib/src/screens/guide_screen.dart: same `theme.colorScheme` and undefined `scheme` issues as Host.
  - apps/player/lib/player_bridge.dart: `SoundService.play` member not found.
  - apps/player/lib/player_bridge.dart + apps/player/lib/player_stats.dart: `recordCompletedGameIfNeeded` / `CompletedGameOutcome` symbols not found.

11) Priority Fix Order (for Gemini)
1. Fix shared cb_theme compile errors first: packages/cb_theme/lib/src/screens/guide_screen.dart
2. Fix dependency/import breakages: `firebase_analytics` (host path), `intl` (player path)
3. Reconcile API drift: CustomDrawer required args, HostBridge.port usage, SoundService and PlayerStats symbol changes
4. Re-run:
   - cd apps/host ; flutter pub get ; flutter test
   - cd apps/player ; flutter pub get ; flutter test

12) Multiplayer Configuration Hardening (Completed This Session)
- Host now enforces one active sync bridge at a time:
  - apps/host/lib/screens/host_home_shell.dart
  - apps/host/lib/screens/lobby_screen.dart
  - local<->cloud switch now stops inactive bridge before starting active bridge.
- Player now isolates local/cloud join state:
  - apps/player/lib/screens/connect_screen.dart
  - switching mode disconnects the other bridge before connect/join.
- Player bridge stability updates:
  - apps/player/lib/cloud_player_bridge.dart (cleans prior subscriptions on rejoin)
  - apps/player/lib/player_bridge.dart (replaces existing local socket client before reconnect)

13) Targeted Multiplayer Analyzer Status (Current)
- Host targeted files: PASS
  - flutter analyze lib/screens/host_home_shell.dart lib/screens/lobby_screen.dart
- Player targeted files: PASS
  - flutter analyze lib/player_bridge.dart lib/screens/connect_screen.dart lib/cloud_player_bridge.dart lib/screens/home_screen.dart lib/screens/game_router.dart

14) Fresh Full Test Run Status (Current)
- Host full tests: FAILED (compilation in shared packages)
  - Role/freezed constructor drift in packages/cb_models (missing/extra fields like complexity/tacticalTip)
  - GameState/freezed constructor drift in packages/cb_models (deadPoolBets/globalDrinkDebt mismatch)
  - cb_theme compile issues (missing cb_theme.dart import path in cb_phase_timeline.dart; missing symbols/icons such as CBColors.errorRed, Icons.skull_rounded)
- Player full tests: FAILED (same shared compile blockers, plus player app dependency)
  - Missing package import: package:intl/intl.dart in apps/player/lib/screens/games_night_screen.dart

15) Manual Multiplayer Seamlessness Checklist (Run on devices/emulators)
- Local Mode Flow
  1. Host in LOCAL mode shows local URL QR with mode=local, host, code.
  2. Player scans/pastes URL and auto-fills host+code.
  3. Player joins and claims identity once; no duplicate claim prompts.
- Cloud Mode Flow
  1. Host in CLOUD mode shows cloud URL QR with mode=cloud and code.
  2. Player scans/pastes URL and joins without requiring host IP.
  3. Reopen player app and ensure reconnect preserves claim when session is active.
- Mode Switch Robustness
  1. In Host lobby, toggle LOCAL -> CLOUD -> LOCAL.
  2. Confirm only one transport path is active each time (no duplicate state updates/joins).
  3. Confirm Player can still join after each switch with matching URL payload.
- Deep Link Runtime Robustness
  1. While Player app is already open, open another join URL.
  2. Confirm debounce prevents repeated sheet spam for same URL.
  3. Confirm connect sheet does not stack multiple times.

16) Shared Blockers Resolved (Current Session)
- Regenerated stale model outputs in packages/cb_models with build_runner (Role/GameState/Player/Session/etc. now aligned).
- Fixed cb_theme compile issues:
  - packages/cb_theme/lib/src/widgets/cb_phase_timeline.dart import path
  - packages/cb_theme/lib/src/widgets/glass_tile.dart invalid CBColors token
  - packages/cb_theme/lib/src/widgets/cb_alliance_graph.dart invalid icon constants
- Added missing dependency for player:
  - apps/player/pubspec.yaml -> intl
- Fixed host compile break in about screen drawer signature:
  - apps/host/lib/screens/about_screen.dart
- Updated smoke tests to initialize mocked Firebase before pumping app roots:
  - apps/host/test/widget_test.dart
  - apps/player/test/widget_test.dart

17) Fresh Final Test Status (Now)
- Host: PASS
  - command: cd apps/host ; flutter test
- Player: PASS
  - command: cd apps/player ; flutter test

18) Current State Summary
- Multiplayer configuration hardening remains in place and analyzer-clean.
- Full host/player test suites are currently passing.
- Remaining work should focus on real-device multiplayer checklist execution (local/cloud/mode switch/deep-link runtime).

19) Multiplayer Checklist Execution Matrix (This Environment)
- Environment capability
  - `flutter devices` reports available targets: Windows desktop, Chrome web, Edge web.

- Verified PASS (code-path + test-backed)
  - Host cloud QR payload includes `mode=cloud` + `code`.
  - Host local QR payload includes `mode=local` + encoded `host` + `code`.
  - Player join URL parser supports both cloud/local payloads and decodes local host URL.
  - Player deep-link runtime guardrails exist and are active:
    - duplicate URL debounce window
    - connect sheet single-instance guard
    - skip auto-open while already connected and outside lobby
  - Host local/cloud toggle is bridge-exclusive (stop inactive, start active).
  - Player mode switch/connect path disconnects non-selected transport first.
  - Full tests currently pass in both apps (`flutter test`).

- Pending MANUAL (interactive runtime verification still needed)
  - Scan cloud QR in Player and verify claim/join flow from camera/deep-link entry.
  - Scan local QR in Player and verify websocket host join over LAN.
  - Toggle Host mode LOCAL -> CLOUD -> LOCAL during active lobby and verify no duplicate events.
  - Open repeated identical join links while Player app is open and confirm no sheet stacking/spam in live UX.

20) Manual Run Script (Operator Steps)
- Terminal A: `cd apps/host ; flutter run -d windows`
- Terminal B: `cd apps/player ; flutter run -d chrome`
- In Host lobby:
  1. Validate cloud QR and local QR modes by toggling SYNC.
  2. Keep one player joined while toggling modes.
- In Player:
  1. Paste/scan host URL payloads and confirm mode auto-fill.
  2. Attempt duplicate deep-link open and verify debounce/single sheet behavior.

21) Auth + Onboarding Stabilization (Latest)
- Host and Player auth providers are now aligned with Riverpod Notifier API (compile-safe).
- Player entry flow now uses unified `PlayerAuthScreen` (Google-first + moniker gate path).
- Host release APK build: PASS.
- Player release web build: PASS.
- Current blocking issues for auth/onboarding flow: none found in build/analyze validation.

22) Setup + Release + CI Follow-Through (Feb 17, 2026)
- Manual role assignment UX in Host Lobby now includes drag-and-drop assignment cards.
  - file: apps/host/lib/screens/lobby_screen.dart
- Host Android release signing setup documentation is now standardized.
  - file: apps/host/android/key.properties.example
  - file: apps/host/README.md
- CI now includes host/player analyzer coverage, host release build hardening, and runtime optimizations.
  - file: .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
  - Improvements include concurrency cancellation, pub/flutter caching, updated action versions,
    and iOS build only on push events.

23) What Is Actually Still Open (Current)
- MANUAL ONLY: Real-device multiplayer execution checklist in section 15/19 remains pending.
- OPS ONLY: Configure production GitHub secrets for host Android signing on `main`:
  - HOST_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64
  - HOST_ANDROID_STORE_PASSWORD
  - HOST_ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS
  - HOST_ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD
- PRODUCT/POLISH: Ghost Lounge + Dead Pool end-to-end parity and multi-slot save system remain roadmap tasks.

24) Suggested Next Engineering Slice
- Run a role-mechanics parity pass using `docs/architecture/role-mechanics.md` as source-of-truth and
  verify each role action logs the expected private notification, host report string, and teaser behavior.

25) Role Mechanics Parity Pass (Completed - Feb 17, 2026)
- Scope completed in `packages/cb_logic/lib/src/night_actions/actions/`:
  - sober_action.dart
  - roofi_action.dart
  - bouncer_action.dart
  - bartender_action.dart
  - club_manager_action.dart
  - messy_bitch_action.dart
  - lightweight_action.dart
  - dealer_action.dart
  - attack_dog_action.dart
  - messy_bitch_kill_action.dart
  - medic_action.dart
  - silver_fox_action.dart
  - whore_action.dart
- Aligned behavior to spreadsheet expectations for:
  - private notifications
  - public teasers (where required)
  - host report phrasing
- Validation:
  - Updated test expectations in `packages/cb_logic/test/night_resolution_test.dart`
  - Test run PASS:
    - `packages/cb_logic/test/night_resolution_test.dart`
    - `packages/cb_logic/test/game_resolution_logic_test.dart`

26) Remaining Work (Current)
- Manual real-device multiplayer checklist execution remains pending (sections 15/19).
- GitHub production signing secrets must be configured in repository settings for strict `main` release enforcement.

27) Manual Multiplayer Verification Matrix (Refreshed - Feb 17, 2026)
- Environment preflight
  - `flutter devices`: available in this environment (Windows/Chrome/Edge reported in prior checks)
  - Host desktop launch attempt: BLOCKED
    - command: `cd apps/host ; flutter run -d windows`
    - result: `Unable to find suitable Visual Studio toolchain. Please run flutter doctor for more details.`

- Checklist status
  1. Host cloud QR payload (`mode=cloud` + `code`)
     - Status: PASS (code-verified)
     - Evidence: `apps/host/lib/widgets/lobby/lobby_access_code_tile.dart`
       - `.../join?mode=cloud&sid=...&code=...`

  2. Host local QR payload (`mode=local` + encoded `host` + `code`)
     - Status: PASS (code-verified)
     - Evidence: same file
       - encodes `ws://ip:port` into `host` query param and includes `mode=local`

  3. Player join URL parser supports cloud/local payload and host decode
     - Status: PASS (code-verified)
     - Evidence: `apps/player/lib/screens/connect_screen.dart`
       - `_tryApplyJoinUrl` parses `mode`, `code`, `host` and decodes local host URL

  4. Host mode switch is transport-exclusive
     - Status: PASS (code-verified)
     - Evidence: `apps/host/lib/widgets/lobby/lobby_config_tile.dart`
       - `_setSyncMode` stops inactive bridge before starting selected bridge

  5. Player mode switch/connect disconnects non-selected transport first
     - Status: PASS (code-verified)
     - Evidence: `apps/player/lib/screens/connect_screen.dart`
       - `_switchMode` and `_connect` disconnect opposite bridge before use

  6. Player bridge regression test coverage (state sync/join accepted path)
     - Status: PASS (test-verified)
     - command: `flutter test apps/player/test/player_bridge_test.dart`
     - result: `15 passed, 0 failed`

  7. Duplicate deep-link debounce + connect-sheet single-instance guard (live UX)
     - Status: PASS (code + test verified), PENDING LIVE UX CONFIRMATION
     - Implementation:
       - `apps/player/lib/screens/home_screen.dart`
         - explicit URL debounce window guard (`shouldAcceptJoinUrlEvent`)
         - ignore pending join URL while already connected outside lobby
       - `apps/player/lib/screens/connect_screen.dart`
         - `_navigatingToClaim` guard to prevent duplicate claim-screen pushes
         - explicit claim-navigation predicate (`shouldNavigateToClaim`)
     - Tests:
       - `apps/player/test/join_link_debounce_test.dart` (new)
       - `apps/player/test/connect_screen_navigation_guard_test.dart` (new)
       - `apps/player/test/player_bridge_test.dart`
       - latest run: PASS (`23 passed, 0 failed` across targeted tests)

28) Operator Next Steps (Unblocked Sequence)
1. Install/repair Visual Studio C++ Desktop toolchain required by Flutter Windows.
2. Re-run host app locally: `cd apps/host ; flutter run -d windows`.
3. Run player app on browser/device and execute checklist sections 15/19 end-to-end.
4. Record PASS/FAIL outcomes per scenario directly under section 27.

29) Runtime Workaround Verified (Latest)
- Chrome attach path is still unreliable in this environment (`Failed to connect to Chrome instance` after DevTools endpoint appears).
- Verified fallback: run both apps on Flutter `web-server` targets.
  - Player: `cd apps/player ; flutter run -d web-server --web-port=5000`
  - Host: `cd apps/host ; flutter run -d web-server --web-port=5001`
- Health checks (executed):
  - `http://localhost:5000` -> HTTP 200
  - `http://localhost:5001` -> HTTP 200
- Use this fallback for manual multiplayer UX checks when Windows desktop toolchain or Chrome attach are blocked.

30) Manual Multiplayer Verification (Live Pass Started - Feb 17, 2026)
- Preflight runtime status: PASS
  - Player endpoint `http://localhost:5000` returned 200
  - Host endpoint `http://localhost:5001` returned 200

- Interactive scenarios (execute in browser windows and mark outcome):
  1. Cloud join URL flow
     - Generate cloud QR on Host
     - Open URL in Player
     - Expected: code prefilled, claim occurs once, lobby join succeeds
     - Status: PENDING MANUAL

  2. Local join URL flow
     - Switch Host to local mode and generate local QR/URL
     - Open URL in Player
     - Expected: host endpoint auto-filled/decoded, join succeeds
     - Status: PENDING MANUAL

  3. Mode switch robustness
     - With a joined player, toggle LOCAL -> CLOUD -> LOCAL in Host lobby
     - Expected: no duplicate join events, no stale bridge updates
     - Status: PENDING MANUAL

  4. Deep-link duplicate suppression
     - While Player app is open, trigger same join link multiple times quickly
     - Expected: no stacked connect sheets, no duplicate claim navigation
     - Status: PENDING MANUAL

31) Automated Checklist Coverage Expansion (Feb 17, 2026)
- Added shared host sync orchestration helper:
  - `apps/host/lib/sync_mode_runtime.dart`
  - `syncHostBridgesForMode(...)` enforces exclusive bridge transitions:
    - cloud mode: stop local -> start cloud
    - local mode: stop cloud -> start local
- Host callsites now use shared helper:
  - `apps/host/lib/screens/host_home_shell.dart`
  - `apps/host/lib/widgets/lobby/lobby_config_tile.dart`
- Added focused host unit tests:
  - `apps/host/test/sync_mode_runtime_test.dart`
  - verifies stop/start order for both cloud and local transitions

- Latest targeted regression test run: PASS
  - `apps/host/test/sync_mode_runtime_test.dart`
  - `apps/player/test/join_link_debounce_test.dart`
  - `apps/player/test/connect_screen_navigation_guard_test.dart`
  - Result: 10 passed, 0 failed

- Remaining truly manual checks are now narrowed to browser/device interaction UX only
  (QR scan flow and in-session repeated-link behavior under real user interaction).

32) Join URL Parser Coverage Added (Feb 17, 2026)
- Extracted pure parser/normalizer helpers in player connect flow:
  - `apps/player/lib/screens/connect_screen.dart`
  - `parseJoinUrlPayload(raw)`
  - `normalizeJoinCode(value)`
- `ConnectScreen._tryApplyJoinUrl(...)` now consumes parsed payload (behavior preserved, testable).

- Added focused parser tests:
  - `apps/player/test/join_url_parser_test.dart`
  - Covers:
    - cloud URL parsing + code normalization
    - local URL parsing + host decode
    - invalid/missing-code URL rejection
    - unknown mode behavior (parse code, mode unset)

- Latest targeted player regression run: PASS
  - `apps/player/test/join_url_parser_test.dart`
  - `apps/player/test/join_link_debounce_test.dart`
  - `apps/player/test/connect_screen_navigation_guard_test.dart`
  - Result: 15 passed, 0 failed

33) Consolidated Targeted Verification + Commit Prep (Feb 17, 2026)
- Consolidated targeted host+player run: PASS
  - `apps/host/test/sync_mode_runtime_test.dart`
  - `apps/host/test/host_bridge_test.dart`
  - `apps/player/test/join_url_parser_test.dart`
  - `apps/player/test/join_link_debounce_test.dart`
  - `apps/player/test/connect_screen_navigation_guard_test.dart`
  - Result: 25 passed, 0 failed

- Commit split helper updated and verified in dry-run:
  - file: `scripts/commit_split.ps1`
  - Group 1 now includes `apps/player/test/join_url_parser_test.dart`
  - Group 3 now includes host sync runtime files/tests:
    - `apps/host/lib/screens/host_home_shell.dart`
    - `apps/host/lib/widgets/lobby/lobby_config_tile.dart`
    - `apps/host/lib/sync_mode_runtime.dart`
    - `apps/host/test/sync_mode_runtime_test.dart`
  - Dry-run completed successfully and repository state remained unchanged.

34) Second Commit + Remaining Tree Triage Map (Feb 17, 2026)

    - wide host/player UI polish files not tied to critical runtime fixes
  - DISCARD OR REGENERATE (low signal/noise):
    - transient logs/artifacts: `analysis_results.txt`, `apps/player/widget_test_output.txt`
    - local workspace files unless intentionally versioned: `*.code-workspace`

35) Commit Pass #3 Completed + Map Refresh (Feb 17, 2026)

      (`apps/host/lib/screens/**`, `apps/host/lib/widgets/**`, `apps/player/lib/widgets/**`).
    - Residual logic extension file in `packages/cb_logic/lib/src/night_actions/resolution/ally_cat_handler.dart`.
  - SHELVE:
    - Broad `cb_theme` widget/style sweep (`packages/cb_theme/lib/src/widgets/**`) as a dedicated styling PR.
  - DISCARD/REGENERATE:
