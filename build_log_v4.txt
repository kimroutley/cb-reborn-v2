Club Blackout Reborn - Build/Validation Log
Date: 2026-02-13
Workspace: C:\Club Blackout Reborn

Summary
- Stale historical errors cleared from this log.
- Actionable lint issues reported earlier were fixed in source files.

Current Validation (focused source + tests scope)
- Checked paths:
  - apps/host/lib
  - apps/player/lib
  - packages/cb_logic/lib
  - packages/cb_models/lib
  - packages/cb_theme/lib
  - packages/cb_comms/lib
  - packages/cb_logic/test
  - packages/cb_models/test
  - packages/cb_theme/test
  - packages/cb_comms/test
  - apps/host/test
  - apps/player/test
- Result: No errors found.

Notes
- Broad workspace diagnostics can include noisy/generated contexts; focused scope above is the canonical health check.
- Test execution via tooling is currently disabled in this session, so a full re-test pass could not be executed here.

Latest known release snapshot (reference)
- Running Gradle task 'assembleRelease'... 144.1s
- Built build\\app\\outputs\\flutter-apk\\app-release.apk (175.2MB)

Current Active Errors
- None in focused source/test scope.

Markdown Lint Pass (2026-02-13)
- Files cleaned:
  - apps/host/README.md
  - apps/player/README.md
  - packages/cb_theme/AUDIO_AUDIT.md
  - packages/cb_theme/assets/audio/README.md
- Result: No markdown lint errors in cleaned files.

Broad Workspace Diagnostics Annotation (2026-02-13)
- Broad scan reported 232 results (truncated output view).
- Classification:
  - Actionable source/test errors: none found in focused source/test scope.
  - Non-actionable/generated noise: results concentrated under generated paths such as
    `packages/cb_comms/build/unit_test_assets/...`.
- Canonical project health remains the focused scope status: clean.

Exclude-Path Implementation (2026-02-13)
- Added workspace excludes in `.vscode/settings.json`:
  - `**/build/unit_test_assets/**`
  - `**/.dart_tool/**`
  - `**/coverage/**`
- Applied to `files.exclude`, `search.exclude`, and `files.watcherExclude`.

Post-Implementation Verification (2026-02-13)
- Focused diagnostics rerun (same source/test scope): No errors found.
- Broad diagnostics rerun still reports generated-path entries (now 235 total shown by tool), centered on `packages/cb_comms/build/unit_test_assets/...`.
- Conclusion: source/test health remains clean; broad generated-context noise remains non-actionable.

UX & UI Refinements Verification (2026-02-13)
- Host shell navigation remains drawer-centric with animated content switching, and redundant bottom navigation/header overlap is removed.
- Settings screen section blocks are standardized to shared `CBSectionHeader` usage for consistent host UI primitives.
