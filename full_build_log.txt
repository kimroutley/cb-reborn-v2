Club Blackout Reborn - Full Build Log (Refreshed)
Date: 2026-02-13
Workspace: C:\Club Blackout Reborn

This file now tracks current-state validation rather than stale verbose tool output.

Focused Diagnostics Sweep

Result

Retest Status

- Full automated test rerun is pending once test execution is enabled.

Reference Build Snapshot
- Running Gradle task 'assembleRelease'... 144.1s
- Built build\\app\\outputs\\flutter-apk\\app-release.apk (175.2MB)

Current Active Errors
- None in focused source/test scope.

Markdown Lint Pass
- apps/host/README.md: clean
- apps/player/README.md: clean
- packages/cb_theme/AUDIO_AUDIT.md: clean
- packages/cb_theme/assets/audio/README.md: clean

Broad Workspace Diagnostics Annotation
- Broad scan currently reports 232 results in total (UI shows first subset).
- These are not present in focused source/test scope.
- Observed broad-scan findings are generated-context noise from paths like:
	- packages/cb_comms/build/unit_test_assets/...
- Actionable source/test errors: none.

Exclude-Path Implementation
- `.vscode/settings.json` updated to reduce generated-path noise in editor tooling:
	- files.exclude: `**/build/unit_test_assets/**`, `**/.dart_tool/**`, `**/coverage/**`
	- search.exclude: `**/build/unit_test_assets/**`, `**/.dart_tool/**`, `**/coverage/**`
	- files.watcherExclude: `**/build/unit_test_assets/**`, `**/.dart_tool/**`, `**/coverage/**`

Post-Implementation Verification
- Focused diagnostics rerun (apps/*/lib, packages/*/lib, and test folders) returned no errors.
- Broad diagnostics rerun still returns generated-path entries (235 total in current tool output), concentrated under `packages/cb_comms/build/unit_test_assets/...`.
- Operational interpretation remains unchanged: focused source/test scope is clean; broad generated-context findings are non-actionable.

Auth + Onboarding Stabilization Verification (2026-02-13)
- Host auth provider migrated to current Riverpod Notifier API and validated.
- Player auth provider migrated to current Riverpod Notifier API and validated.
- Player app entry switched from legacy `PhoneAuthGate` to unified `PlayerAuthScreen` gate.
- Player Google Sign-In dependency added in `apps/player/pubspec.yaml`.
- Host Auth UI Overhaul: Applied "Neon Glass" aesthetic to HostAuthScreen with:
	- Animated radiance backgrounds and cinematic Hero transitions.
	- Themed terminal-style login blurb and secure fallback dividers.
	- Consolidated error containers with biometric verification status feedback.
- Production builds completed successfully:
	- Host: `flutter build apk --release` → success (`apps/host/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`)
	- Player: `flutter build web --release --no-wasm-dry-run` → success (`apps/player/build/web`)
- Analyzer status:
	- No compile errors in Host or Player app scopes.
	- All manual UI polishes verified as lint-free.


UX & UI Refinements Verification (2026-02-13)
- Host shell navigation remains drawer-centric with animated content switching, and redundant bottom navigation/header overlap is removed.
- Settings screen section blocks are standardized to shared `CBSectionHeader` usage for consistent host UI primitives.
- Home screen footer text contrast improved for accessibility.
- MiniTag component refactored for modern Material 3 styling and dynamic colors.
- RosterTile and VoteTallyPanel components migrated to Material 3 dynamic colors.
- `GodModePanel` migrated to Material 3 dynamic colors.
- `TacticalMonitor` migrated to Material 3 dynamic colors.
- `EffectsOverlay` migrated to Material 3 dynamic colors.
- `GuidesScreen` is now context-aware, receiving `gameState` from the provider.
- `LogsView` now displays a placeholder timestamp, with a `TODO` for `GameState` to store actual timestamps for proper implementation.

All planned Host UI polish and hardening, including bug fixes, theme migration, and contrast improvements, have been completed.
